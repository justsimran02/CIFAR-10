# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project aims to build and train a deep learning model to classify images into these 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary objective is to achieve high accuracy in image classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 32x32 pixel color image, belonging to one of the following 10 classes:

1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture is designed to capture the spatial hierarchies in the image data effectively.

Example model architecture:
```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Dropout(0.25),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set. Below are some sample results:

- **Training Accuracy**: Y%
- **Validation Accuracy**: Z%
- **Test Accuracy**: X%

## Future Work

- Experiment with different architectures such as ResNet, VGG, or DenseNet.
- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
